# Superbowl Squares
This is a simple web tool for generating a randomized grid of [Superbowl Squares](https://www.wikihow.com/Play-Football-Squares) (sometimes referred to as a 'points grid' or 'football squares'). Generated grids are saved to a database and accessible via a custom URL.


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

[Deployed via Vercel](https://points-grid.vercel.app/)
